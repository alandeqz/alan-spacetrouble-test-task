## Getting Started

1. To run the application, one needs to have the Docker installed on their machine.

2. The following command should be executed to run the project locally:
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   or running the following command is also fine:
   ```
   make run
   ```

After the containers are up and running, one can access the documentation of the API endpoints at http://localhost:8080/v1/swagger/index.html.
